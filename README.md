# merchant-identifier
Quick example of NER to identify merchants from financial transaction data


The Plan

My goal with this project is to show some good basic ML training principles and keep it under 3 hours. 

I chose spaCy projects because it runs fine locally, and it allows you to quickly make a training pipeline with explicit dependencies (e.g. run the pretraining step before training step), and has some nice support for running that pipeline (e.g. if the pretraining step takes an hour to run, making sure it only has to run once and then the rest of the pipeline can pick up after that step). 

Planning the outline:
- Start with an extremely lightweight model so I can try things out locally on my laptop 
- Bootstrap out a training/validation dataset. I'm hoping I can do pretraining on a (full?) unlabeled dataset, and then only have a small labeled dataset.
- If there’s time, test out better models from hugging face. 
- If there’s even more time, slap the model into fastAPI to serve it


Limitations:
I would’ve liked to use a model that can also use the other fields beyond just the description, but I suspect some of those are generated by other ML models and it might be a trash-in-trash-out situation, so I’m not too pressed about it.
