# merchant-identifier
Quick example of NER to identify merchants from financial transaction data


# The Plan

My goal with this project is to show some good basic ML training principles and keep it under 3 hours. 

I chose spaCy projects because it runs fine locally, and it allows you to quickly make a training pipeline with explicit dependencies (e.g. run the pretraining step before training step), and has some nice support for running that pipeline (e.g. if the pretraining step takes an hour to run, making sure it only has to run once and then the rest of the pipeline can pick up after that step). 

## The plan outline:
- Start with an extremely lightweight model so I can try things out locally on my laptop 
- Bootstrap out a training/validation dataset. I'm hoping I can do pretraining on a (full?) unlabeled dataset, and then only have a small labeled dataset. (Update: I ended up using pattern matching as part of the model to bootstrap my dataset. I don't love having that in the final product, because it means maintaining a list of essentially regex keywords. spaCy does do a better job than regex since it works on tokens instead of raw text, making it faster and more accurate when words are truncated, but I'd still use the pattern matching component just for the initial prototyping.)
- If there’s time, test out better models from hugging face. 
- If there’s even more time, slap the model into fastAPI to serve it. 


## Limitations:
- I would’ve liked to use a model that can also use the other fields beyond just the description, but I suspect some of those are generated by other ML models and it might be a trash-in-trash-out situation, so I’m not too pressed about it.
- Could've used some of the "cleaner" descriptions to auto-label some observations. In the past I've seen that some financial sources just have the merchant name in the description. Descriptions from those sources can be used to make a database of merchants. 
- My base model has many other types of named entities, like locations and people, that are muddying up the results. I'd like to tailor them more to this use case.
- Didn't do anything fancy like model versioning or running on GPU
